# callbackApp

Been working on looping callbacks and here is another example of a simple application that uses this technique, it's a little different from what I've been putting out in this category but I think it could be a useful addition to the repetoire. The key here seems to be providing data to the result array that can be accessed by following methods. So if you operate on a piece of data and it isn't returned by the method, the easiest thing to do is provide a getter in the callback chain.
